## Introduction

Welcome to my NFT gallery website! This was designed to showcase a NFT collections based on the wallet address but now making it opensource to the bulic. It allows users to display NFTs from the Ethereum and Polygon Blockchain.

## Why I Made It

I created this website initially to showcase my own NFT collection so I could put the website on LinkTree. However after googeling I wasn't able to find a valid provider that will do this job. Every Website I found was inputting a address and it will display the images. However I wanted a more static yet dynamic solution. This is the solution

## Make if yours!
