# Dynamic NFT Gallery
**Current Version: 1.1**

## Introduction

Welcome to my NFT gallery website! This was designed to showcase a NFT collections based on the wallet address but now making it opensource to the bulic. It allows users to display NFTs from the Ethereum and Polygon Blockchain.

## Why I Made It

I created this website initially to showcase my own NFT collection so I could put the website on LinkTree. However after googeling I wasn't able to find a valid provider that will do this job. Every Website I found was inputting a address and it will display the images. However I wanted a more static yet dynamic solution. This is the solution


## Features

- Interactive NFT gallery
- Smooth hover effects and animations
- Integration with Ethereum and Polygon blockchains
- Supports multiple wallets:
    - First wallet address is the "main" wallet and will be loaded on reload
    - Every subsequent wallet will be loaded in about 3 seconds after each other due to API limitations.
- Customizable based on your wallet address and NFTs
- Using the Archemy API
- Customizable Filter against scam or unwanted NFTs
